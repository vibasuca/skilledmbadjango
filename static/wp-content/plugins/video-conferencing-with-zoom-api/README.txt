**QUICK DEMO:**

== Installation ==
Search for the plugin -> add new dialog and click install, or download and extract the plugin, and copy the the Zoom plugin folder into your wp-content/plugins directory and activate.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Migrating from JWT to Server to Server method =

As of June 2023, Zoom will deprecate JWT App type - the plugin has moved to Server-to-Server OAuth App and SDK App type for Join via Browser / Web SDK support. If you face any Zoom connection issues then this might be the issue. Refer to this [Documentation](https://zoomdocs.codemanas.com/migration/ "Documentation") on how to migrate your old JWT method.

= Join via Browser showing Signature Invalid or Timeout =

Please check if you SDK app type is activated and re-check all the app credentials are valid.

= Updating to version 4.0.0 =

Please check how you can do the [Migration from JWT](https://zoomdocs.codemanas.com/migration/ "Migration from JWT")

= Add users not working for me =

The plugin settings allow you to add and manage users. But, you should remember that you can add users in accordance with the Zoom Plans, so they will be active for the chosen plan. More information about Zoom pricing plans you can find here: https://zoom.us/pricing

= Join via Browser not working, Camera and Audio not detected =

This issue is because of HTTPS protocol. You need to use HTTPS to be able to allow browser to send audio and video.

= Blank page for Single Meetings page =

If you face blank page in this situation you should refer to [Template Overriding](https://zoomdocs.codemanas.com/template_override/#content-not-showing "Template Overriding") and see Template override section.

This happens because of the single meeting page template from the plugin not being supported by your theme and i cannot make my plugin support for every theme page template because of which you'll need to override the plugin template from my plugin to your theme's standard. ( Basically, like how WooCommerce does!! )

= Countdown not showing/ guess is undefined error in my console log =

If countdown is not working for you then the first thing you'll nweed to verify is whether your meeting got created successfully or not. You can do so by going to wp-admin > Zoom Meetings > Select your created meeting and on top right check if there are "Start Meeting", "join Meeting links". If there are those links then, you are good on meeting.

However, even though meeting is created and you are not seeing countdown timer then, you might want to check your browser console and see if there is any "guess is undefined" error. If so, there might be a plugin conflict using the same moment.js library. **Report to me in this case**

= Forminator plugin conflict fix =

Please check this thread: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/conflict-with-forminator-2/

= How to show Zoom Meetings on Front =

* By using shortcode like [zoom_api_link meeting_id="123456789"] you can show the link of your meeting in front.

= How to override plugin template to your theme =

1. Goto **wp-content/plugins/video-conferencing-with-zoom-api/templates**
2. Goto your active theme folder to create new folder. Create a folder such as **yourtheme/video-conferencing-zoom/{template-file.php}**
3. Replace **template-file.php** with the file you need to override.
4. Overriding shortcode template is also the same process inside folder **templates/shortcode**

= Do i need a Zoom Account ? =

Yes, you should be registered in Zoom. Also, depending on the zoom account plan you are using - Number of hosts/users will vary.
